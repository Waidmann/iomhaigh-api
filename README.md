# Iomhaigh API

First things first; Iomhaigh roughly translates to "profile" or "image". Yes, extremely cliche - packing whatever you want to create into google translate and searching for something that sounds decent.

This project serves two purposes:

- Freshening up my .NET and Angular skills
- Having a good looking website to present myself

## Backend

This git repository contains the backend for the project. It should be deployed to AWS along with the [frontend](https://github.com/Waidmann/iomhaigh-gui) and database.

A couple of things to note:

- I used the mediator pattern (Implemented using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)) for logging
- MySql is used as database and it is initialized through code

## Result

You can view the deployed project [here](http://www.waidmann.dev/)! (soonâ„¢)
